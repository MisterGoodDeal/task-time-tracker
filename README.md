## 📖 Usage

### Adding a Ticket to Tracking

1. Ensure your current branch contains a ticket ID matching your configured prefixes
2. In the Task Time Tracker panel, click the **"Add to tracking"** button (📄 icon)
3. The ticket will be automatically added to the current month's tracking

- Each ticket displays:
  - Ticket ID
  - Status (En cours / Completion date)
  - Time spent in days (rounded to configured increment)
  - **Precise time breakdown** in format: `Xj Yh Zm` (days, hours, minutes)
    - Example: `2j 5h 30m` means 2 days, 5 hours, and 30 minutes
    - Only non-zero units are displayed
    - Seconds are shown only if all other units are zero
  - Associated branch name

### Exporting Monthly Tracking

   - Copy all tracking data to the new location
   - Update the storage preference
   - Remove data from the old location
5. This is useful when:
   - You want to share tracking data across multiple projects (use User settings)
   - You want project-specific tracking (use Workspace settings)

### Configuring Days Off

3. Click on the "Days off" line to open the configuration dialog
4. Select the days of the week when you don't work (e.g., Saturday and Sunday)
5. Selected days will be excluded from all time calculations
6. This is useful for:
   - Excluding weekends from your time tracking
   - Excluding specific weekdays when you don't work
   - Ensuring accurate time calculations that only count working days

### Automatic Features

- **Branch switching**: When you switch Git branches, active tickets are automatically paused
- **Auto-resume**: If you switch to a branch whose ticket is already tracked, tracking automatically resumes
- **Real-time updates**: Time spent is calculated in real-time for active tickets

## 🎯 How It Works

### Ticket Detection

The extension uses regex patterns to extract ticket IDs from branch names:

- Pattern: `{PREFIX}-{NUMBER}` (case-insensitive)
- Example: `feat/GDD-750_my-feature` → `GDD-750`

### Time Calculation

Time is calculated based on:

- **Working hours**: Only time within your configured work hours counts
- **Days off**: Days configured as "days off" are completely excluded from time calculations
- **Increments**: Time is rounded to your configured increment (default: 0.5 days) for the days display
- **Precise calculation**: Detailed breakdown (days, hours, minutes, seconds) is calculated separately and shown alongside the rounded days
- **Minimum**: Minimum tracked time equals your configured time increment
- **Multiple sessions**: Overlapping periods on the same day are automatically merged to avoid double-counting
- **Real-time updates**: For active tickets, the precise time is recalculated every minute

### Data Storage

Tracking data can be stored in either workspace settings or user settings:

- **Workspace settings** (default): Data is stored in `.vscode/settings.json` and is project-specific
- **User settings**: Data is stored globally and shared across all workspaces
- **Easy migration**: Click on the storage location in the quick settings to migrate data between workspace and user settings
- Organized by month and year
- Each ticket contains:
  - Ticket ID and full URL
  - Branch name
  - Work periods (start/end dates)
  - Author information
  - Calculated time spent (in days, rounded to increment)
  - **Precise time spent** (days, hours, minutes, seconds) - automatically recalculated on each access
